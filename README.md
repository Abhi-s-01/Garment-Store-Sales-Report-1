# Garment Store Sales Analysis

## Description
This project aims to analyze the sales data of a garment store through an interactive dashboard created using advanced Excel techniques. It involves web scraping to extract sales records, data cleaning for accuracy, importing and structuring data in Excel, identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), constructing pivot tables for analysis, visualizing data through graphs and charts, and implementing slicers for interactive dashboard navigation.

## Key Features
- Web scraping for data extraction
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Excel data import and structuring
- Pivot table creation for KPI analysis
- Graphical visualization of data
- Implementation of slicers for interactivity

## Technologies Used
- Excel (including pivot tables, slicers, and data cleaning techniques)


## Installation
There's no specific installation required for this project as it primarily utilizes Excel and web scraping tools. However, ensure you have Excel installed on your system for data analysis.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Excel file containing the sales data.
3. Enable macros if prompted (for slicers functionality).
4. Navigate through the dashboard using slicers to interact with the data.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time data sources for automatic updates.
- Expansion of analysis to include additional metrics and dimensions.
- Deployment of the dashboard to a web-based platform for wider accessibility.
